# pathlib

`pathlib` is a Gleam library for manipulating UNIX paths, similar to Python's `os.path` functionality.


## Quick start

```sh
# Build the project
rebar3 compile

# Run the eunit tests
rebar3 eunit

# Run the Erlang REPL
rebar3 shell
```


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://www.rebar3.org/docs/dependencies#section-declaring-dependencies)
this package can be installed by adding `pathlib` to your `rebar.config` dependencies:

```erlang
{deps, [
    pathlib
]}.
```
